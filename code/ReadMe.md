**blinktemp.py**
-----------------------------

This python program uses an DHT11 temp sensor and on the press of a touch sensor it will cause an LED to blink and then display the current temperature reading. 

For this program you will need to install the Adafruit DHT Python Library.
You can install this through python3-pip with the command,

&nbsp; &nbsp;*sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT*
