**Spring 2020 Embedded Linux Class. -- Midterm**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository documents my class work and projects done for **CPS342**

This branch contains the content for the CPS 342 Midterm. 
We are to take the index.html and flaskServer.py files given and have them
work with a python script previously written to take temperature readings and
output them to a database. The final product will be a website that reads these 
values including a button added by us that will blink an LED.
